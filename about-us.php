<h2>David Nance</h2>
<p>Art is not a separate thing in my life, everything I see is through
eyes that work on painting possibilities. How would I go about capturing
that? How could I see that differently?</p>
<p>The fact that I can be moved by art has always fascinated me, the
way I can be drawn into more than what I am seeing. It is like when a
piece of music takes me to a time or place.</p>
<p>When I am painting I am inspired by the quality of light, how it defines
and sculpts the subject. I have been using oil paints for the past few
years to give me control over hard and soft edges. There is a little more
blending time with the oils. There is also a luminous quality that
responds well to chasing the light.</p>
<p>Over time I have developed a vocabulary of brushwork to describe what
I see and express feeling in my work. I like using familiar subjects
and paint them in a way that leaves something for the imagination.</p>

<h2>Paul Nance</h2>
<p>My interests have always been in mechanical design and curious of
how things worked. I started my design in textile industry, drafting
and designing looms, narrow fabric knitting machines. After the textile
industry changed I moved into more wood and metal working machine
design, as technology changed the need to move from drafting board type
work to computer generated design using AutoCAD and SolidWorks
type software.
<p>After working for more than 30 years in the industry, it was decided
to collaborate with my brother (David) and start a business combining
my creative experiences to design and make various wood items.</p>
<p>We chose a CNC woodworking machine "Shopbot" to allow us to create
simple and complex designs. Starting out with signage for commercial use,
adding personalized items for weddings, home decor and simple furniture
pieces.</p>
<p>Look over the <a href="/our-work">Our Work</a> page for items that we have
completed or are currently working on. We can help with small
production runs if there are examples you can provide we will be glad to quote.</p>
<p>Let us know if there is anything we can help you with!</p>
