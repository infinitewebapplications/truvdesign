    <p>After working individually for 30+ years in the industry, brothers David and

    carvings. If you need a sign for your commercial business, wedding, any
    furniture pieces or home d&eacute;cor â€“ TruVdesign is able to accommodate your needs

  <h2 class="mt-0">Paul Nance</h2>
  <p>Paul has always had a strong interest for mechanical design which led him to
  start his career in the textile industry over 30+ years ago. There, he drafted
  and designed looms, narrow fabric machines and other complex machinery.
  Following his career in the textile industry, due to significant industrial
  changes, he shifted his focus to wood and metal machinery design. As technology
  advanced and evolved, Paul adapted and moved the drafting board work to
  computer generated designs using AutoCAD and SolidWorks software.</p>
